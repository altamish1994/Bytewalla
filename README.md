Introduction:

Middle East countries especially Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and India have been plagued with natural disasters and their number is increasing day by day. With such incident the death tolls have also been increased to a greater extend. The Major cause of the deaths during disasters is unavailability of communication between the rescue team and the victims. The problem has been partially catered by single-hop communication but single-hop communication is not as helpful as multi-hop. So we are trying to extend the project to multi-hop research and its development in a useful manner so that the end user is facilitated more from this application.
